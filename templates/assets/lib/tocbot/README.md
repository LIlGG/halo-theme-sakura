Tocbot builds a [table of contents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_contents) (TOC) from headings in an HTML document. This is useful for documentation websites or long markdown pages because it makes them easier to navigate. This library was inspired by [Tocify](http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js/), the main difference is that Tocbot uses native DOM methods and avoids the jQuery & jQuery UI dependencies.


## Get Started

You can use npm to install it or include the script on the page with HTML.

[**Download it here**](https://github.com/tscanlin/tocbot/releases/)


### Include JS

Install it with npm.

```sh
npm install --save tocbot
```

OR

Include the script at the bottom of the page before the closing body tag.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tocbot/4.11.1/tocbot.min.js"></script>
```


### Include CSS

CSS is used for expanding & collapsing groupings and some basic styling.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tocbot/4.11.1/tocbot.css">
```

OR

If you installed it with npm and use sass / postcss you might try importing the styles from 'node_modules', [see the includePath option documentation for more info](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths)

```scss
@import 'tocbot/src/scss/tocbot';
```


### Usage

Initialize the script at the bottom of the page before the closing body tag.

```js
tocbot.init({
  // Where to render the table of contents.
  tocSelector: '.js-toc',
  // Where to grab the headings to build the table of contents.
  contentSelector: '.js-toc-content',
  // Which headings to grab inside of the contentSelector element.
  headingSelector: 'h1, h2, h3',
  // For headings inside relative or absolute positioned containers within content.
  hasInnerContainers: true,
});
```

**NOTE:** Make sure the body is scrollable and the document headings have id attributes, tocbot and your browser needs these things to make hashes jump to the proper heading, some markdown libraries (like [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)) already do this for you.

If content in the div has changed then trigger a refresh (optionally with new options).

```javascript
tocbot.refresh();
```

Also you can use it within typescript:

```typescript
import * as tocbot from 'tocbot';

tocbot.init({
  // Options
});

tocbot.refresh();

tocbot.destroy();
```

## Requirements

This library uses **vanilla JavaScript**. It is less than 350 bytes of CSS and about 3.6Kb of JavaScript (minified and gzipped) it also has no dependencies.

This script works in **all modern browsers and IE 9+**.

**Make sure rendered headings have id attributes**, some markdown libraries (like [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)) already do this. If you need to do this client side see [this script](https://github.com/tscanlin/tocbot/blob/master/src/utils/make-ids.js).

**NOTE:** to exclude anchor elements from smooth scrolling, add the class `no-smooth-scroll`.


### Fixed headers

To handle anchor links properly when you have a fixed header, I recommend using CSS similar to the following:

```css
h1::before, h2::before, h3::before, h4::before, h5::before, h6::before {
    display: block;
    content: " ";
    height: 60px;
    margin-top: -60px;
    visibility: hidden;
}
```

This is better than javascript solutions since it will work when javascript is disabled.


## API

### Options

```javascript
// Where to render the table of contents.
tocSelector: '.js-toc',
// Where to grab the headings to build the table of contents.
contentSelector: '.js-toc-content',
// Which headings to grab inside of the contentSelector element.
headingSelector: 'h1, h2, h3',
// Headings that match the ignoreSelector will be skipped.
ignoreSelector: '.js-toc-ignore',
// For headings inside relative or absolute positioned containers within content.
hasInnerContainers: false,
// Main class to add to links.
linkClass: 'toc-link',
// Extra classes to add to links.
extraLinkClasses: '',
// Class to add to active links,
// the link corresponding to the top most heading on the page.
activeLinkClass: 'is-active-link',
// Main class to add to lists.
listClass: 'toc-list',
// Extra classes to add to lists.
extraListClasses: '',
// Class that gets added when a list should be collapsed.
isCollapsedClass: 'is-collapsed',
// Class that gets added when a list should be able
// to be collapsed but isn't necessarily collapsed.
collapsibleClass: 'is-collapsible',
// Class to add to list items.
listItemClass: 'toc-list-item',
// How many heading levels should not be collapsed.
// For example, number 6 will show everything since
// there are only 6 heading levels and number 0 will collapse them all.
// The sections that are hidden will open
// and close as you scroll to headings within them.
collapseDepth: 0,
// Smooth scrolling enabled.
scrollSmooth: true,
// Smooth scroll duration.
scrollSmoothDuration: 420,
// Callback for scroll end.
scrollEndCallback: function (e) { },
// Headings offset between the headings and the top of the document (this is meant for minor adjustments).
// Can also be used to account for scroll height discrepancies from the use of css scroll-padding-top
headingsOffset: 1,
// Timeout between events firing to make sure it's
// not too rapid (for performance reasons).
throttleTimeout: 50,
// Element to add the positionFixedClass to.
positionFixedSelector: null,
// Fixed position class to add to make sidebar fixed after scrolling
// down past the fixedSidebarOffset.
positionFixedClass: 'is-position-fixed',
// fixedSidebarOffset can be any number but by default is set
// to auto which sets the fixedSidebarOffset to the sidebar
// element's offsetTop from the top of the document on init.
fixedSidebarOffset: 'auto',
// includeHtml can be set to true to include the HTML markup from the
// heading node instead of just including the textContent.
includeHtml: false,
// onclick function to apply to all links in toc. will be called with
// the event as the first parameter, and this can be used to stop,
// propagation, prevent default or perform action
onClick: false,
// orderedList can be set to false to generate unordered lists (ul)
// instead of ordered lists (ol)
orderedList: true,
// If there is a fixed article scroll container, set to calculate titles' offset
scrollContainer: null,
// prevent ToC DOM rendering if it's already rendered by an external system
skipRendering: false,
// Optional callback to change heading labels.
// For example it can be used to cut down and put ellipses on multiline headings you deem too long.
// Called each time a heading is parsed. Expects a string in return, the modified label to display.
headingLabelCallback: function (string) => string,
// ignore headings that are hidden in DOM
ignoreHiddenElements: false,
// Optional callback to modify properties of parsed headings.
// The heading element is passed in node parameter and information parsed by default parser is provided in obj parameter.
// Function has to return the same or modified obj.
// The heading will be excluded from TOC if nothing is returned.
// function (object, HTMLElement) => object | void
headingObjectCallback: null,
// Set the base path, useful if you use a `base` tag in `head`.
basePath: '',
// Only takes affect when `tocSelector` is scrolling,
// keep the toc scroll position in sync with the content.
disableTocScrollSync: false,
```


### Methods

#### .init

Initialize tocbot with an options object.

```javascript
tocbot.init(options)
```

#### .destroy

Destroy tocbot and remove event listeners.

```javascript
tocbot.destroy()
```

#### .refresh

Refresh tocbot if the document changes and it needs to be rebuilt.

```javascript
tocbot.refresh()
```


## Troubleshooting

- Tocbot scrolls to the right position onClick but highlighting doesn't seem to show the active section
  - Try running this from the console: `tocbot.refresh({ ...tocbot.options, hasInnerContainers: true })`. If that works then one option (`hasInnerContainers: true`) to handle inner containers should be all you need to add.
